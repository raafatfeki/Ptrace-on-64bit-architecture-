II- The registers:

The list of registers used by the system calls:

--------------------32bit syscall registres--------------------
Syscall number	Param 1	Param 2	Param 3	Param 4	Param 5	Param 6
eax		ebx	ecx	edx	esi	edi	ebp

--------------------64bit syscall registres--------------------
Syscall number	Param 1	Param 2	Param 3	Param 4	Param 5	Param 6
rax		rdi	rsi	rdx	r10	r8	r9

The returned value are stored in eax(32bit) and in rax(64bit).

All these registers are defined in the user_regs_struct structure.But the latter defines two different variables for the syscall number and the returned value which are respectively orig_rax and rax.
